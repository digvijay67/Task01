# Library Management System (Java + MySQL)

## üìå Project Overview
This is a simple **Library Management System** implemented using **Java** and **MySQL**.  
The project allows you to:  

1. Add new students  
2. Add new books  
3. Issue books to students (only existing students and books)  
4. Display live issued book details with **student name, book name, and issue date/time**  

The system ensures database integrity with **foreign keys** and **auto-increment IDs**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- **Java JDK 11+**
- **MySQL 8+**
- **MySQL Workbench** (or any MySQL client)
- JDBC Connector (MySQL Connector/J)
- IDE (VS Code insider)


Tips -- for Running Your Java + MySQL Project in VS Code

Run MySQL / My Workbench First
Before running your Java program, make sure your MySQL server is running.
Open MySQL Workbench and execute all your RDBMS SQL scripts (creating the database and tables) first.
This ensures your database and tables exist before Java tries to connect.
Use Correct Database Path in Java.

In your Java code, make sure the JDBC URL matches your database:
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/library_db";
String user = "root";
String password = "Root"; // change if needed

The database name in the URL (library_db) should be the same as the one you created in MySQL Workbench.
